Every node i initially chooses an arbitrary number,
say xi . When node i contacts node j, they each
update their value as:    
  *(xi + xj)/2*  
after this exchange, both i and j will have the
same value.  
– Eventually all nodes will have the same value,
namely, the average of all initial values  
– Propagation speed is again exponential
